// C Language Family Front-end
//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//

Welcome to LFort.  This is a compiler front-end for the C family of languages
(C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++) which is built as part of the LLVM
compiler infrastructure project.

Unlike many other compiler frontends, LFort is useful for a number of things
beyond just compiling code: we intend for LFort to be host to a number of
different source level tools.  One example of this is the LFort Static Analyzer.

If you're interested in more (including how to build LFort) it is best to read
the relevant web sites.  Here are some pointers:
